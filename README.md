Okay so everyone please read what's in here it is important

# Firstly, 
If you forgot how to use GitHub or wanna retrain yourself, there is a tutorial linked below
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/


# Secondly,
It is of utmost importance that you do not just edit the files from the master branch.
Please make your own branch (title it your name) to make edits and pull a request so that the other two developers, or at least the one that the change pertains to, is able to see what you did and why.
It is probably also very helpful to download the github app on your pc so you can u can edit the files in a python ide
If you do make an edit, please make add a description explaining what you did and why.

If you are asked to merge someone else's change to the master branch, then first review what happened, and think why is this better then what it was before.
If you believe it is better (which it always should be because we should let each other know we are going to make an edit on discord), then merge it and make a comment as to what changed (the comment should already be there by the person who edited in the first place).


# Finally,
Let's make this an amazing app, one that will make sure we get first motherfreaking place at that competition!
